    <string name="naturequets">Whether it is watching blue, rolling waves crash against the sandy shore or hearing birds chirping in a green, luscious forest, there is something so remarkable and beautiful about being immersed in nature. It’s easy to be swept away with today’s technology and fast-paced living, but no matter where you are, nature always has a way of bringing peace to the mind and grounding a person.</string>

    <string name="privacypolicy">Account Registration Information
In some instances, use of the Clients on Demand Website and Services may require that you disclose certain personal information for identification, including a unique email address and demographic information (including, for example, ZIP code, age, sex, job industry, job title, and income) to register.

Billing and Credit Card Information
Our Services comprise, generally business coaching Webinars, Seminars and materials distributed on a subscription basis. To enable payment, we collect and store name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card information, and other billing information. This information will only be shared with third parties who facilitate completion of the purchase transaction, such as by fulfilling orders and processing credit card payments.

We will not disclose your billing and/or credit card information unless required by law or a court order, or unless disclosure is required to address an issue implicated by the financial transaction. For instance, if you claim that your billing and/or credit card information was used to make a purchase you did not authorize, details about the transaction may be disclosed to law enforcement and any party we deem necessary to address the matter.

How this Information is Used
The information we collect is used for a variety of purposes, such as:

to enable your use of our services and fulfill your requests for certain features, such as enabling you to participate in and renew paid services, polls, and message boards;
by performing statistical, demographic and marketing analyses of users of our services to improve our relationship with our customers
for product development purposes and to generally inform advertisers about the nature of our subscriber base to improve our relationship with our customers;
to customize your experience by allowing advertising to be targeted to the users for whom such advertising is most pertinent
Direct Communication
An important aspect of our services includes direct communication with our customers. As a result, we will periodically send you communications to your email, text, or voice mailbox, via telephone, fax, cell phone, email, paper mail, or any other delivery method regarding the products or services you may have purchased through this Website. We may also send you information about product or service updates, new features, or information we believe you may find interesting. We may send you information regarding other products and services we offer.

How to access, correct, delete or exercise other rights regarding your Personal Information
If you would like to request to access, correct, object to the use, restrict or delete personal information that you have previously provided to us, or if you would like to request to receive an electronic copy of your personal information for purposes of transmitting it to another company, you may contact us at support@russruffino.com with the subject line “Data Subject Request.” We will attempt to comply with your request. However, the nature of our business, along with the applicable law governing our business, requires us to retain your information for several years. Please also note that we may need to retain certain information for recordkeeping purposes and/or to complete any transactions that you began prior to requesting a change or deletion (e.g., when you make a purchase or enter a promotion, you may not be able to change or delete the personal information provided until after the completion of such purchase or promotion). There may also be residual information that will remain within our databases and other records, which will not be removed.

As a result, we cannot guarantee the deletion of all your information. But, when we receive a deletion request, we will remove your applicable information from our marketing and billing systems accordingly. This will ensure that there are no further mailings or billings directed towards you.

As we continue to refine our systems, we will establish a method for the complete removal of all user information from the system without compromising our legal and ethical duties. This document will evolve as these new methods are defined and tested for permanent account deletion.

For your protection, we may only implement requests with respect to the personal information associated with the particular email address that you use to send us your request, and we may need to verify your identity before implementing your request. We will try to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable.

Your choices regarding our use and disclosure of information
We may use the information you provide for marketing purposes such as promotional emailing, direct mail, and sales contacts. We give you many choices regarding our use and disclosure of your personal information for marketing purposes. You may opt-out from receiving electronic communications from us if you are a user of products or services and no longer want to receive marketing-related emails from us on a going-forward basis, you may opt-out of receiving these marketing-related emails by sending a request for list removal to support@russruffino.com. If you have provided your information to us, and opt-out, we will put in place processes to honor your request. This may entail keeping some information for the purpose of remembering that you have opted-out.

We will try to comply with your request(s) as soon as reasonably practicable. Please also note that if you do opt-out of receiving marketing-related emails from us, we may still send you messages for administrative or other purposes directly relating to your use of the products or services, and you cannot opt-out from receiving those messages.

Data Retention
We will retain your personal information for as long as needed or permitted in light of the purpose(s) for which it was obtained and consistent with applicable law. The criteria used to determine our retention periods include:

The length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you and provide the Services to you (for example, for as long as you have an account with us or keep using the Services);
Whether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject (for example, certain laws require us to keep records of your transactions for a certain period of time before we can delete them); or
Whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position (such as in regard to applicable statutes of limitations, litigation or regulatory investigations).
